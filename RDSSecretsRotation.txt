We Use AWS Secrets Manager for this purpose. 
It has builtin feature for database user credentials rotation with builtin integrations to 
PostgreSQL on RDS. It also allows easy auditing interation with CloudTrail or CloudWatch to alert
administrator for various events.
STEPS:
1. Create a PostgreSQL DB instance
2. From the secrets manager console, crete credentials for an RDS database super user.
3. Create an IAM user with a policy having just enough permissions to store secrets in 
secrets Manager
4. From the secrets manager, select the credential rotation interval days, encryption settings 
and the RDS instance we created in step 1 for credential access 
5. Put a value for the Secret Name which is to be used to fetch the secrets for the applications
which are accessing the database. 
6. The applications accessing the database should be updated to use the secrets manager API 
to fetch the secrets
